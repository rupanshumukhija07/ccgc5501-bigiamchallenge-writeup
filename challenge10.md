# Challenge Overview

The primary goal of this challenge was to access a secret stored in AWS Systems Manager (SSM) and retrieve the flag. The challenge focused on AWS IAM role assumption and permissions management, specifically navigating the steps involved in assuming a role, analyzing IAM permissions, and retrieving a secret from SSM.

### write a short analysis about the Assignment here

This challenge required navigating through AWS IAM roles, permissions, and leveraging AWS CLI commands. The setup involved assuming the "Alexander-Arnold" IAM role from a non-root user account. The main tasks were to review the IAM role policies, assume the role, and ultimately retrieve a secret from AWS Systems Manager (SSM). By assuming the role, I gained the necessary permissions to access the specific secret and successfully complete the challenge.

Key Tasks:

Role Assumption: Initially, the non-root user lacked the necessary permissions to assume the role.

Policy Modification: The trust policy of the IAM role "Alexander-Arnold" was updated to allow the non-root user to assume it.

Secret Access: The ultimate goal was to retrieve a specific secret from AWS Secrets Manager using the AWS CLI.

### Steps Taken to Solve the Challenge

1. Initial Role Assumption Attempt:

I began by attempting to assume the "Alexander-Arnold" role using the AWS CLI. The command executed was:
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::307946660251:role/Alexander-Arnold --role-session-name Alexander-Arnold

However, this attempt failed because the non-root user did not have the required permissions to assume the role.

2. Modifying the Trust Relationship: 

Upon realizing that the trust policy for the "Alexander-Arnold" role did not allow the non-root user to assume it, I updated the AssumeRolePolicyDocument of the role to include the non-root user as a valid principal:
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::307946660251:user/ctf-starting-user",
          "arn:aws:iam::307946660251:user/non-root-user"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

3. Assumed Role Access: 
After updating the trust policy, I successfully assumed the "Alexander-Arnold" role by executing the following command:
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::307946660251:role/Alexander-Arnold --role-session-name Alexander-Arnold

This returned temporary security credentials, enabling further actions.

4. Secret Retrieval: 
With the correct permissions in place, I used the AWS CLI to retrieve the secret stored in AWS Systems Manager (SSM) by running:
aws secretsmanager get-secret-value --secret-id DomainAdministrator-Credentials --region us-west-2 --profile assumed-role

This returned the secret:
FLAG{backwards::IfYouFindSomethingInterstingFindWhoHasAccessToIt}

5. Analysis of Permissions: 
I analyzed the permissions associated with the assumed role "Alexander-Arnold" and confirmed that the role granted permission to access the secret. The policies attached to the role aligned with the challenge's objective and were configured correctly.


### Cleanup instructions: 
```
No specific cleanup tasks were required for this challenge as it involved assuming an existing role and retrieving a predefined secret. However, I ensured that the "cloudfoxable" profile remained intact for future challenges.

```

## Flag Retrieval
After successfully querying the secret, the flag was retrieved in the format: FLAG{backwards::IfYouFindSomethingInterstingFindWhoHasAccessToIt}




## Reflection
What was my approach? 
The approach involved following the instructions to assume the "Alexander-Arnold" role and retrieve the secret from AWS Systems Manager. By using AWS CLI commands, I analyzed IAM roles and permissions, which allowed me to retrieve the flag.

What was the biggest challenge?
The biggest challenge was the trust relationship between the IAM role and the non-root user. The "Alexander-Arnold" roleâ€™s trust policy initially only allowed one specific user to assume it, which prevented access. Modifying the trust policy was crucial to proceed.

How did I overcome the challenges? 
I overcame the challenge by modifying the AssumeRolePolicyDocument to include the non-root user as a valid principal. After that, I successfully assumed the role and used the AWS CLI to retrieve the flag.

What led to the breakthrough? 
The breakthrough came when I realized that the role's trust policy needed to be updated to allow the non-root user to assume it. Once the policy was updated, I successfully assumed the role and completed the challenge.

On the blue side, how can the learning be used to properly defend important assets? 
    In a real-world scenario, the following defensive practices are essential to protect cloud assets:

    Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure that only authorized users and roles have the permissions to perform specific tasks, such as assuming roles or accessing sensitive resources.

    Monitoring Access: Regularly audit IAM roles and policies to identify and correct unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed.

    Secure Access Methods: Use secure methods like AWS Systems Manager to manage and access sensitive secrets rather than relying on insecure methods.

By adhering to these principles, organizations can better secure their cloud environments and limit access to only authorized personnel and resources.
